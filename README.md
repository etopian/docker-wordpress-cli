# docker-wordpress-cli
A Python based CLI to help you deploy WordPress on Docker using nginx-proxy and Alpine Linux.

This is a work in progress. Current aim is to only support Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

This deploys the site on the host system under /data/sites/domain.tld

It will then install the site for you as well.
